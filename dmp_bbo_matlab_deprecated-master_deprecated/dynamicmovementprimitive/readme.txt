This is a simple implementation optimized for legibility, not functionality. It uses analytical
integration as much as possible. Therefore, the DMP is not able to react to perturbations or
changing goals, and the phase cannot be held.

See the help of the functions, and call them without arguments to run a test function that provides
a visualization.
